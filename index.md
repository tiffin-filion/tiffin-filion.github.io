* [Jubilee](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/jubilee/index.html) - I had a bit of direction, but I started to learn how to develop a static web page from a PSD.
* [Rogue](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/rogue/index.html)- I learned how to develop a static web page with nothing but a PSD file for guidance.
* [HTML Final](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/skillcrush-html-final/index.html) - I was given the choice of a few layouts and the PSD for each. I then had to recreate the page and then change the design (colors, fonts, images, content, etc) to my liking. I also added a second page that showed more projects that Iâ€™ve completed.
