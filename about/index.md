<h1>About Tiffin</h1>
<h4>Current Senior QA Analyst| Future Automation QA Analyst</h4>
<br>
<p>My journey started back in the late 90's with the start of the internet. I learned HTML by reading a book. Granted, there wasn't much to it, and there was no CSS at the time.<p>
<p>Fast forward a few years after high school and I decided to get my Bachelor's Degree in Web Development. I learned HMTL, CSS, Java and Flash...because all the sites were using Flash at the time. Just before finishing my degree I was hired at a company that allowed me to use a bit of my skills.</p>
<p>As technology has advanced, my knowledge had become obsolete. So I made sure to keep my skills up-to-date utilizing free and paid sites. In Covid times after I got laid off, I decided to go back to school full-time and update my Web Development skills. I did end up getting a job and got an Associates Degree in Web Development in 2023.</p>
<p>My newest job has allowed me to delve into automated testing. Learning Java and Python has really helped me create better tests.</p>
